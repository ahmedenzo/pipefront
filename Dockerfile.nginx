# Step 2: Use Nginx to serve the Angular app
FROM nginx:latest

# Copy the custom Nginx configuration file
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Copy the built Angular app from the Node.js build container
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 so that Nginx can serve the app
EXPOSE 80

# Run Nginx in the foreground (this will keep the container running)
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
